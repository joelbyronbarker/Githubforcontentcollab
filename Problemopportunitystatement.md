# Collaboration with Github

## Problem/Opportunity Statement
There are technical capabilities that could enhance how we collaborate on writing. How can we assemble them so that they enable **great** writing that does its assignment — and gets completed **efficiently**?

Writing was not easily collaborative for millenia, but now the expectation is that it needs to be. What has always been true is that we need **input** and **approval** for corporate writing. 

Corporate writing is (among other things)
* Marketing content
* Technical documentation
* Internal vision and organizational documents
* {Any contributor welcome to add types of writing here}

### Feature innovations that are now a part of the work of writing.

Writing technology changes how we write. Printing presses and book binding made writing mass media. Desktop publishing made publication populist. In the last 30 years, software capabilities change not just how writing is delivered but _how we write at all._

* With the advent of computer word processors, a file could be edited by multiple people who shared it. 

* Redline, track changes, and document compare features were created. One creator, editor, or reviewer could see the changes that another made. It helps one to discern changes and clarifies the workflow.

* The comment feature allowed one contributor to put up a message to other contributors about the creation of the document. 

* Then, much later, live collaboration came into play. A document located not in a file system but in a cloud application could be edited simultaneously by multiple people. 

In parallel, software development is going through a rich maturation. 
* In response to the failures of waterfall project management methods (which were modeled after large physical construction projects) to produce large scale software, Agile methodologies broke projects into small sprints with small teams.
* Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) toolchains encourage constant updating and rollout of code. Automated testing, blue/green rollout, and easy rollbacks are layers ofof assurance that make rapid feature and fix deployments possible without regular top-down approval.
* Code repositories grew and matured to the point that GitHub now holds 200 million repositories. It added 16 million users in 2021. The rollout of new features is blistering. 
* Organizations like Kubernetes govern themselves (with corporate influence) and maintain a code base, multiple websites, documentation, and all variety of shared content in GitHub.

Acknowledged: GitHub was built for code. English language is not what it was meant to hold, though that is confusing to people who see them both as simply strings of characters.

## Notable differences between code writing and English language writing mindsets:
* What is a softwrap or a line return? Most coding languages ignore line breaks so coders simply put them in for readability. English cares, and in fact has the idea of a **paragraph** which is a subjective division of topics that is necessary for readability and a serious consideration when composing. Otherwise, English needs to wrap as whatever layout tool allows it do. Frequently in our digital world it needs to vary based on the screen it is read upon.
* Multiple spaces together in English is almost always an error. It is information and direction to many programming languages.
* Code has absolute meaning. Human languages have highly fungible meaning.
* {more could be added here}

That said, 
## there are reasons that applying the tools for one to the other makes sense
Code revisions are similar to text edits in some ways.
* We need reviewers to catch syntax errors and typos. Nobody is perfect and we need process that does not expect us to be.
* We need to track drafts and drive to approval so we can launch. Content assets and programs have value only when the get read or run.
* The fundamental thing reviewers do is to apply their unique or delegated expertise. 
	* For example in content marketing writing (just one type of language writing collaboration) We might need a project manager, a subject matter expert, and a marketing strategist to all agree that what we say works for the objective. They either 
		* make changes to actual characters on the screen (in which case we need to **track changes**).
		* make comments on a particular character or group of characters requesting a change (in which case we need to **create and comments**).
	* {Something about what code revisions do and why we need certain features}

So, they are not the same but could benefit from what each other needs. 

## Some ideas of how to embrace the collision as the metaphors mix
Git pull requests are on an _issue_. Reviews are more of a _session_ that cover several issues. In writing like to have as few passes as possible by reviewers — out of respect for people’s time.

Can we train people to make each _issue_ a pull request instead of making a _session review_? JBB hates asking for more complex tasks by reviewers. We get the best from them when they are as comfortable with the tools as possible. Wondering “am I doing this technically correct” is not going to get great input.
